rqaGui
======

A graphical frontend to the CRP binary

This script is meant to provide a simple (yet convenient?) GUI for
interacting with the crp commandline programme.
It uses **TKinter** (just because) and has home-made progressbar 
(for whatever reason). 

Essentially it just
pipes the given parameters to the programme and stores/displays
the output. The actual binary has be download from 
http://tocsy.pik-potsdam.de/commandline-rp.php 
Be sure to read the docs there too. 

For more details and screenshots see: http://dreeg.org/

Note: It's quite old and I have not worked on it in a while.
